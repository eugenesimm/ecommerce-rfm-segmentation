# 📊 Hybrid Customer Segmentation & Revenue Analysis

Olist E-commerce Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

## Overview
This data analysis project combines SQL-based RFM customer segmentation with short-term revenue forecasting to diagnose revenue concentration and support actionable retention strategies.


## Business Questions

- Which customer groups are actually driving revenue?
- How concentrated is revenue across customers?
- Are there early warning signals in short-term revenue trends?
- What actions should be taken by customer segment?

## Approach
**SQL (PostgreSQL)**
- Built customer-level RFM metrics using delivered orders only
- Prevented double-counting by aggregating payments at the order level first

**Python**
- Explored customer structure using KMeans clustering
- Reframed segments using rule-based RFM for clearer business actionability

**Forecasting**
- Generated a 30-day revenue forecast to identify short-term risk signals

**Tableau**
- Designed an executive-level dashboard focused on “so what?” questions

## Key Insights
- Approximately 30% of customers generate over 55% of total revenue (VIP segment)  
- Pure clustering alone was insufficient for action-oriented segmentation  
- Rule-based RFM provided clearer targeting criteria for marketing decisions
- Revenue composition shows potential shifts when comparing recent performance to short-term forecasts
